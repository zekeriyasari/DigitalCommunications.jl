The waveform $s_i(t)$ is corrupted by an additive white Gaussian noise $n_i(t)$ which is asssumed to be zero mean and to have a constant power spectral density of $N_0/2$. `Detector` recovers the trasmitted symbol $m_i$ as $\\hat{m}_i$. Due to the corruption in the channel, errornous detection occurs in the detector. This errornous detection is quantified as the probability of symbol error $P_e$ in terms of the channel noise level given as the energy per symbol to noise power spectral density ratio $\\dfrac{E_s}{N_0}$."
