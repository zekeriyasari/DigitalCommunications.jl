The waveform $s_i(t)$ is corrupted by an additive white Gaussian noise $n_i(t)$ which is asssumed to be zero mean and to have a constant power spectral density of $N_0/2$. `Detector` recovers the trasmitted symbol $m_i$ as $\\hat{m}_i$. Due to the corruption in the channel, errornous detection occurs in the detector. This errornous detection is quantified as the probability of symbol error $P_e$ in terms of the channel noise level given as the energy per symbol to noise power spectral density ratio $\\dfrac{E_s}{N_0}$."

    "Having investigated the blocks to some extent, we can now run the complete simulation. In the code block given below, we adjust the noise level, i.e `esno`, of the channel for the noise level range set above, corrupt the transmitted symbols in the channel and detect the transmitted `message` in the detector as `mbar`. A symbol error is calculated for each noise level . At last, the numerical error results are compared to theoretically expected values. For the sake of comparison, the theoretical expectations and numerical results are ploted. The plots show that the results are quitte close to each other. "
